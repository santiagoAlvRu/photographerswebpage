  <p class="paragraph pt-3">
    Hello! I'm <strong>Johm Doe</strong>, a passionate and dedicated
    photographer based in <strong>Vienna</strong>. With over
    <strong>20</strong> years of experience in the field, I specialize in
    capturing the essence of moments through my lens.
  </p>
  <p>
    My journey in photography began when I was
    <strong>20</strong>, and since then, I've been driven by the desire to tell
    stories through compelling visuals. Whether it's a wedding, a portrait
    session, or a commercial project, I strive to create images that are not
    only aesthetically pleasing but also emotionally resonant.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe that every photograph is a unique piece of art, and I take pride
    in delivering high-quality work that exceeds my clients' expectations. My
    style is a blend of classic and contemporary, with a focus on natural light
    and authentic emotions.
